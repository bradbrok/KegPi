# KegPi
A Raspberry Pi based keggerator management system built on GPIO based flow sensors.

Materials List:

* A Keggerator, you can buy or build on your own.
* 1 Raspberry Pi.
* [Flow Meter](https://www.adafruit.com/products/828) - I'm using the ones from AdaFruit. However, andy hall effect flow sensor will work. They just need to be calibrated by calling the calibration method.
