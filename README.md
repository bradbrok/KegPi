# KegPi
A Raspberry Pi based keggerator management system that is built on Flask! Just plug in two flow sensors into the GPIO and run the kegpi.py and kegpiapp.py to get started!

Materials List:

* A Keggerator, you can buy or build on your own.
* 1 Raspberry Pi (Preferrably a the Pi2).
* [Flow Meter](https://www.adafruit.com/products/828) - I'm using the ones from AdaFruit. Any hall effect flow sensor will work. They just need to be calibrated by calling the calibration method.
